# API Contract: Interactive Code Execution Service

## Purpose
This contract defines the interface for executing code examples within the Physical AI Book documentation. This enables the "Hands-On Learning First" principle from the constitution.

## Endpoints

### POST /api/code/execute
Execute a code snippet and return the result

**Request**:
```json
{
  "code": "string (the code to execute)",
  "language": "string (programming language)",
  "dependencies": "array of strings (required packages)",
  "timeout": "number (execution timeout in ms, default 10000)"
}
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "success": "boolean",
  "output": "string (stdout/stderr)",
  "result": "string (execution result)",
  "error": "string (error message if failed)",
  "executionTime": "number (time taken in ms)"
}
```

**Status Codes**:
- 200: Code executed successfully
- 400: Invalid request format
- 408: Execution timeout
- 500: Execution error

### GET /api/code/validate
Validate code syntax without executing

**Request**:
```json
{
  "code": "string (the code to validate)",
  "language": "string (programming language)"
}
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "valid": "boolean",
  "errors": "array of strings (validation errors)",
  "warnings": "array of strings (validation warnings)"
}
```

## Security Considerations
- Code execution is sandboxed
- Resource limits enforced (CPU, memory, network)
- No file system access allowed
- Timeouts prevent infinite loops
