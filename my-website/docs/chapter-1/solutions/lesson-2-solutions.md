# Lesson 2: Sample Solutions

## Exercise: Physical AI System Design

### Sample Answer: Automated Plant Watering System

**System Design:**

**Sensors needed:**
- Soil moisture sensors to detect when plants need water
- Light sensors to determine optimal watering times
- Temperature sensors to adjust watering based on evaporation rates
- Cameras to monitor plant health and growth

**Actuators required:**
- Water pumps to deliver precise amounts of water
- Valves to control water flow to different plants
- Rotating platform to position watering nozzle
- LED grow lights for supplemental lighting

**Adaptation to environmental variations:**
- Adjust watering schedule based on weather forecasts
- Modify water amounts based on seasonal changes
- Learn optimal watering patterns for different plant types
- Adapt to changes in plant size and water requirements

**Perception-Action Cycle:**
1. Perceive: Monitor soil moisture, light levels, and temperature
2. Process: Determine if watering is needed and how much water to apply
3. Decide: Activate appropriate pumps and valves
4. Act: Deliver water to plants
5. Perceive: Monitor changes in soil moisture and plant health
6. Repeat: Continuous monitoring and adjustment

## Additional Insights

This example demonstrates how Physical AI systems must consider multiple environmental factors and adapt their behavior based on changing conditions. The perception-action cycle is crucial for maintaining optimal plant health while conserving water resources.
