# Lesson 3: Sample Solutions

## Exercise: Physical AI Application Analysis

### Sample Answer: Healthcare Robotics Analysis

**Technical Challenges:**
- Sterility requirements: Systems must maintain medical-grade cleanliness
- Precision requirements: Small errors can have significant consequences
- Safety protocols: Must operate safely around vulnerable patients
- Integration complexity: Need to work with existing medical equipment
- Regulatory compliance: Must meet FDA and other regulatory standards

**Core Principles Application:**
- Embodiment: Surgical robots must be designed for specific procedures
- Perception-Action Cycle: Real-time feedback for precise movements
- Learning through Interaction: Improving techniques based on outcomes
- Real-time Constraints: Immediate response required for patient safety

**Safety and Ethical Considerations:**
- Patient safety as top priority
- Clear boundaries for autonomous vs. human-controlled operations
- Data privacy for patient information
- Liability and responsibility for AI decisions
- Informed consent for AI-assisted procedures

**Future Evolution:**
- More autonomous systems with reduced human oversight
- Integration with diagnostic AI for comprehensive care
- Advanced haptic feedback for better surgeon control
- Predictive capabilities to anticipate patient needs
- Standardization across different healthcare systems
