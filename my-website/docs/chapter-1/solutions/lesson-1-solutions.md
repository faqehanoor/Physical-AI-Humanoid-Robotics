# Lesson 1: Sample Solutions

## Exercise: Physical AI Component Analysis

### Sample Answer:
In a typical office environment, a Physical AI system might include:

**Sensors needed:**
- Cameras for visual perception of objects and obstacles
- LIDAR for precise distance measurements
- Microphones for voice commands or environmental sounds
- Tactile sensors for object manipulation
- Temperature/humidity sensors for environmental awareness

**Actions it could perform:**
- Navigate around desks and chairs
- Pick up and deliver small objects
- Open doors or drawers
- Operate light switches
- Interact with computer interfaces

**How it would learn from interactions:**
- Remember frequently traveled paths
- Adapt to changes in room layout
- Learn preferences for task execution
- Improve object recognition accuracy over time

## Additional Insights

This exercise demonstrates how Physical AI systems must be designed with awareness of their operating environment. The choice of sensors and actuators directly impacts the system's capabilities and limitations.
